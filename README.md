# `gpii-pouchdb`

This package provides [Fluid components](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/UnderstandingInfusionComponents.html)
that wrap [PouchDB](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb) and [express-pouchdb](https://github.com/pouchdb/express-pouchdb).
You can use the same data, design documents, and REST calls as you would with CouchDB.
